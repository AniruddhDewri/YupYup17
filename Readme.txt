Hello. This is my personal repository where I store code I've made by myself or with others' help.
This is something I'm using as I complete my course in Computer Sciences.

Most (if not all) of the things you're going to find here are experimental (or ought to be).
I've got only one Python 3.7 program (yet) here, and will probably upload some more in the near future.

If you notice any bugs/glitches in the programs I've made, please send me a message. Any help is appreciated.
Thank you for checking out my programs (or bothering to come by here, at the very least)!
